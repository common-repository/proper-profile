Automagically turn the email addresses you collect into full featured profiles.

== Description ==
Automagically turn the email addresses you collect into full featured profiles, so you can make better informed decisions!

You collect email addresses every day -- whether they are users of your service, leads you generate, or customers you sell to.
Sure, you might also have their name and perhaps their mailing address. But what interests them? What do they really like? Who are their friends? What kind of influence do they have?
They are certainly more than just an email address, they are real people.

And once you know them better, you can take actions that benefit your business! Friend them on Facebook, understand what other products might interest them, reach their friends and understand their influence.
Proper Profile helps you to answer all of these questions and more. We automagically turn any email address into a full featured profile, so you can really get to know the people behind them.
